# Deep Learning Models for Online Retail Sales Forecasting

## Intro

This study presents a comprehensive comparison of deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and transformer models, for sales forecasting in the online retail industry. The focus is on evaluating their prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability in diverse retail contexts.

## Problem

The rapid expansion of online shopping has highlighted the importance of precise sales forecasting for inventory control and strategic planning. Traditional forecasting methods often fall short in capturing the complex patterns inherent in online retail data, necessitating the exploration of advanced deep learning techniques.

## Role

As a researcher and data analyst, my role was to conduct an in-depth comparative study of various deep learning models. This involved analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for improving sales forecasting accuracy in the dynamic domain of online retail.

## Contribution

My contributions were centered around:
- Evaluating the effectiveness of different deep learning models using historical sales data.
- Assessing the prediction performance, computational effectiveness, and versatility of these models in various retail scenarios.
- Providing valuable insights into each model's strengths and limitations to aid in informed decision-making and resource allocation.

## Outcome

The research concluded that certain models, like the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), outperformed others in terms of predictive accuracy and efficiency. The study also emphasized the significance of model interpretability and its impact on practical application in the retail industry.

## Learning

This study enhanced my understanding of:
- The complexities of online retail sales data and the application of deep learning models.
- The importance of choosing the right model based on specific retail contexts and requirements.
